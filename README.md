## Building

To build this, ensure you have the Rust toolchain installed or install it at [rustup.rs](https://rustup.rs). Then build the project at the root folder with `cargo run`. Before running, make sure to change `src/ADMIN_PASSWORD.txt` to your desired admin password. If you already have data from the database, move the file `site.db` into the root directory and all of the files into `files/*`.
